## Day 1-2

### Tuple 
Tuples allow you to store several values together in a single value. That might sound like arrays, but tuples are different:

You can’t add or remove items from a tuple; they are fixed in size.
You can’t change the type of items in a tuple; they always have the same types they were created with.
You can access items in a tuple using numerical positions or by naming them, but Swift won’t let you read numbers or names that don’t exist.

### Enum
Enums are a way of grouping related values so you can use them without spelling mistakes.
You can attach raw values to enums so they can be created from integers or strings, or you can add associated values to store additional information about each case.
